SMLs is one of my own hare-brained schemes. It’s a platform for sharing media, with a name that just so happens to fit my initials (Coincidence of course). The idea is that as well as everybody having a private page of their own submissions, there are communities and themes which will display submissions from a group of people. The concept was originally based on a collision between tumblr and facebook style sharing. It’s also on the backburner, mostly because i can’t find any of my original code, so I may start from scratch. Oops.
